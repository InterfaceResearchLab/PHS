![](https://github.com/InterfaceResearchLab/PHS/blob/main/Assets/desktop-secured-1536x1134.png)

## Course Description
This course introduces practical aspects of hardware security for integrated circuits and reconfigurable hardware, with hands-on assignments introducing physical, side-channel, and system-level hardware attacks and countermeasures.

## Experiments List
1. Physical Unclonable Functions
2. Machine Learning Attack on PUF
3. Pseudo and True Randomness
4. Side Channel Analysis Attacks (Part 1): Statistical Analysis of Information Leakage
5. Side Channel Analysis Attacks (Part 2): Finding Patterns in the Power Side Channel
6. Side Channel Analysis Attacks (Part 3): Extracting Secrets from Power Consumption
7. Side Channel Analysis Attacks (Part 4): Security for Internet-of-Things (IoT)
8. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Security
10. Software-Activated Hardware Trojans

> The material in some of the experiments is based on tutorials from the ChipWhisperer paltform. For more information please visit the ![ChipWhisperer Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/newaetech/chipwhisperer-jupyter/tree/master) repository.

## Funding
Development of this course was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant DGE-1954259 ("SaTC: EDU: Improving Student Learning through Competitive Embedded System Security Challenges")
